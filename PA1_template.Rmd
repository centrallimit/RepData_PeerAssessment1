## Loading and preprocessing the data
This section describes the data integration process. First of all, 
```{r echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)


setwd("~/Documents/RepData_PeerAssessment1")

df_act <- tbl_df(read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ","))



```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r echo = TRUE}

am_step <- mean(df_act$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
med_step <- median(df_act$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The mean total number of steps taken per day is `r am_step` and the median is `r med_step`.

```{r echo = TRUE}

hist(df_act$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
